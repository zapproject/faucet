## How To Receive Kovan & BSC Zap
  
### Steps

- Step 1. Click the clipboard icon to copy the Zap Token address for either Kovan or BSC Testnets.

- Step 2. Open MetaMask and verify the network being tested matches the network the address was copied from.

- Step 3. In MetaMask locate and click the ```Add Token``` button to redirect towards the ```Add Tokens``` page.

- Step 4. In MetaMask paste the copied address into the ```Token Contract Address``` input field and the ```Token Symbol & Token Decimal``` input field will autopopulate.

- Step 5. In MetaMask verify, there is enough testnet tokens in for the network being tested to complete the ```Get ZAP``` transaction. If not, follow this link to receive Kovan ETH https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet or this link to receive BSC BNB https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart.

- Step 6. In MetaMask verify, either Kovan ETH or BSC BNB tokens are added to the MetaMask account.

- Step 7. Once the testnet tokens are added, click the ```Get ZAP``` button to receive either 1K Kovan ZAP or 500K BSC ZAP, depending on which network the Zap Token address was added and the network MetaMask is on. If MetaMask is not on Kovan or BSC, clicking the ```Get ZAP``` button will cause the error message ```Network Id: 1 is not supported. Please switch to Kovan Testnet(42) or BSC Testnet(97)``` to alert. A succesful transaction will display the address the tokens are being sent to, the Faucet address where the tokens are being sent from, and a clickable transaction hash link that routes to either Etherscan if the network is Kovan or BscScan if the network is BSC.
